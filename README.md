Use createAsyncThunk to declare asynchronous action generators and make HTTP requests. Do the processing of the actions and change data in Redux state with createSlice.

Declare the following operations:

fetchContacts - get an array of contacts (GET method) by GET request. The basic type of action "contacts/fetchAll".
addContact - add contact (POST method). Basic type of action "contacts/addContact".
deleteContact - deletes a contact (DELETE method). Basic type of action "contacts/deleteContact".
